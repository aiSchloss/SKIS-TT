Let's start with the epilogue. Mom, on the verge of her centenary, is watching a movie about a writer she knows very well. The writer is shown at his home in Paris, among his
own books, in the library that serves as his office. The window of the room overlooks the
schoolyard. Recess. The noise is incredible. The viewer learns that for a quarter of a century the
writer worked as a teacher and now, having chosen a house with windows overlooking the schoolyard,
has become like a railwayman who, after retiring, settles near a
sorting station. Then the writer is shown in Spain, in Italy; here he is talking with
translators, here he is joking with his Venetian friends, here he is striding in
solitude on the mountain plateau in Vercors1, surrounded by hazy distances, and talks about
his profession, about language, style, novel structure, characters... Another office, this
time with windows overlooking the Alpine beauties. All these scenes are interspersed with shots in which his
favorite artists talk about their work: the filmmaker and writer Dai
Sijie, the illustrator Jean-Jacques Sempé, the singer Thomas Fersen, the artist Jürg Kreienbühl.
Paris again. The writer is at the computer, now among his dictionaries. This is his
passion, he says. And then we learn (this is the end of the film) that the article about the writer was included in
the dictionary "Robert", under the letter "P", under the heading "Pennac", and meanwhile his real name
is Pennacchioni, and his name is Daniel.
And now mom is watching this movie with my brother Bernard, who recorded it
for her on cassette. Watches from beginning to end, without looking up, without saying a word, sitting
motionless in his chair amid the gathering twilight.
The end of the film.
Titles.
Silence.
Then, slowly turning to Bernard, she asks: “Do you think he’ll ever
get out of this?”

The thing is, I was a bad student and she never recovered from it. Today, when her
senile consciousness more and more often leaves the shores of the present, smoothly rolling back to the distant
archipelagos of memory, the very first reefs encountered on this path remind her of the
anxiety that tormented her all my school years.
Turning a worried look on me, she slowly says: “So what are you
doing?”
My future has always seemed so doubtful to her that she is still not
sure of my present. She always believed that nothing good would come of me, and
so that I could at least somehow stay afloat, I, in her opinion, was not sufficiently
"equipped". I was a useless son. True, when I first entered the
class as a teacher in September 1969, she realized that I had somehow gotten out. However, all subsequent
decades (in other words, my entire adult life) her anxiety for me secretly
resisted all the evidence of my success that she received from my calls,
letters, visits, books published, newspaper articles or television appearances on the show
Bernard Pivot Neither the stability of my professional life, nor the recognition of my
literary activity - nothing of what she learned about me from others or what she
read in the press could reassure her completely. Of course, she was happy for my
success, discussed them with friends, agreed that her father, who had died without ever knowing about
them, would have been simply happy, but in the depths of her heart the anxiety that
the same dunce 2 I once was had sown there continued to live. And in this was expressed her

2 In fact, French schools use a twenty-point grading system, and our
numerous deuces are not actually given there. The original uses the word cancre (lit. lazy, stupid),
maternal love. When I started to make fun of the joys of motherhood, she
answered with a sweet joke a la Woody Allen: “What do you want? Not all Jewesses are mothers, but all
mothers are Jewesses.”
And today, when my old Jewish mother is no longer quite present in the
present, this anxiety is again read in her eyes, fixed on the youngest
sixty-year-old. Anxiety, noticeably weakened, this fossilized anxiety,
which has turned more into a habit, but is still sharp enough for her to take me by the
hand and ask at the moment of parting: “Do you have an apartment in Paris?”

So, I was a bad student. As a child, every evening, returning home from school, I
felt that she would not let me go. My diary announced the teachers' displeasure.
When I was not the last in the class, I was the penultimate. (Champagne!) Tightly
closed first for arithmetic, then for mathematics, deeply and chronically
illiterate, stubbornly unreceptive to memorizing dates and determining
location on the map, unable to learn foreign languages, an inveterate
slacker (unlearned lessons, undone homework), I brought home the miserable
results of my studies, which could not be redeemed by either success in music, or sports
achievements, or any other extracurricular activity.
"Do you understand? Do you at least understand what I'm explaining to you?"
I did not understand. This inability to understand was rooted so far in my childhood
that in search of its origins, the family composed a legend, according to which it all began when I was
mastering the alphabet. All my life I heard talk that it took me a whole year to memorize the letter “a”.
The letter “a” is a year. The desert of my ignorance began with the
insurmountable letter “b”.
“No panic: in about twenty-six years, he will learn the whole alphabet,” my father
tried to dispel his own fears with irony. Many years later, when I was left for the
second year in the final class, in order to still get the certificate of maturity that was stubbornly not given to me, he would say otherwise: “Don’t worry, in the end, even with the final
exams, automatism is developed...”
Or in September 1968, when I received my philology degree: “You needed a revolution3 to get a degree.
Well, if you decide on a dissertation, wait for a world
war?”
All this was said completely without malice. It was a kind of conspiracy. My father and I
quickly chose laughter as a means of communication.
But back to the beginning of my activity. The youngest of four sons, I turned out to be a
special case. My parents did not manage to train on my older brothers,
whose school years, if not brilliant, were at least fairly smooth.
My impenetrable stupidity constantly led them into a stupor. “I just give
up,” “No, I can’t do it anymore!” — these exclamations, familiar to me,
were accompanied by looks in which a gulf of distrust gaped, generated by
my inability to learn anything.
Everyone understood everything faster than me.
“Well, you are a perfect cork!”
One day, in the year of graduation (one of the years of graduation), when my father
for the translation of which the Russian “dunce” is most suitable, meaning the same concept - a bad
student who carries this stigma all his school years.
3 In 1968, student and subsequent workers' unrest in France became the beginning of a
serious crisis, which is sometimes equated by historians with a revolution.
was explaining trigonometry to me in the room that served as our library, our dog quietly
lay down behind our backs on the bed. After some time, he was discovered and
immediately expelled: “Get out, dog! Go to your chair!”
However, not even five minutes had passed before the dog was again lying on the bed. He simply
dragged his old bedding from his chair and settled down on it. Which caused, of course,
universal deserved admiration: the animal was able to connect the prohibition with the abstract idea of
​​purity and conclude that to stay in the company of the owners, he needed to take care of the
bedding. What a clever boy, because this is a real logical construction! A funny event
became a topic of home conversations for years to come. I, on the other hand, learned my lesson from what happened:
even a mongrel thinks faster than me. It seems that I then hissed in his ear: “Tomorrow you will
go to school yourself, you sycophantic mug!”

Two middle-aged gentlemen are walking along the bank of the Lu, the river of their childhood. Two brothers.
My brother Bernard and I. Half a century before, they dived into these clear waters. They swam among the
bleaks, who were not at all frightened by their splashing. The familiarity of the fish led to the
thought that happiness would last forever. The river flowed between the boulders. When the brothers got
along it to the sea - sometimes floating with the current, sometimes jumping from stone to stone - they happened to
lose sight of each other. In order not to get lost, they learned to whistle with two fingers.
Long trills were reflected from the rocky shores.
Today the river has become shallow, the fish have disappeared, the slimy stagnant foam testifies to the victory of
detergents over nature. All that remains of our childhood is the singing of cicadas and the resinous
sunny heat. And we still know how to whistle with two fingers and have never lost
each other by “ear”.
I confess to Bernard that I dream of writing a book about school; not about the school that
changes with a changing society, as this river changes, no, but about this
endless cycle, about what remains unchanged, namely about a certain constant
value that is never talked about: about the joint suffering of a dunce, his parents
and his teachers, about the interaction of these school sufferings.
- Wow, what a program... Well, where are you going to start?
- With you, for example. What are your memories of my stupidity,
say... in mathematics?
My brother Bernard, the only one in our family, was able to help me with my lessons
so that I would not withdraw into myself like an oyster in its shell. We shared with him
one room until my very transition to the fifth grade, when I was sent to a boarding school.
- In mathematics? Well, you know, it started with arithmetic! Once I asked what
you needed to do with the fraction you were sitting on. And you answered automatically: “It must be
reduced to a common denominator.” The fraction was one, therefore, the denominator was
also one, but you persisted: “It must be reduced to a common denominator!” I tried to
get through to you: “Use your brain, Daniel, there is only one fraction here, which means the
denominator is one! », but you bristled: «The mathematician said: fractions must be reduced to a common
denominator!»
And two adult uncles smiled, continuing their walk. It's all so far away.
One of them has worked as a teacher for twenty-five years: two and a half thousand students, something
like that, many of them, as they say, are “difficult to educate”. Both are already fathers of families.
“The mathematician said...” they themselves hear it now. The spell into which the dunce
puts all his hopes, yes... The teacher's words are the logs to which the poor fellow
clings, floating with the current that carries him to the waterfall. He repeats what the
teacher said. Not because there is any sense in it, not in order to apply a certain
rule, no, but in order to get away from questions - at least for a while, so that he, in the end,
would be left behind. Or to be loved. At all costs.
- So, another book about school? Do you think there are not enough of them?
- It's not about school! Everyone is only engaged in school, the eternal disputes of old and new:
programs, social role, goals, school today, school tomorrow... No, this will be a book about
...
